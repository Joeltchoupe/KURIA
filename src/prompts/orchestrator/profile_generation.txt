</context>

<task>
Based on the scan data and clarity score, determine:

1. **Company Profile**:
   - Size category: micro (<20), small (20-100), medium (100-500)
   - Growth stage: startup, scaling, mature
   - Primary industry/sector
   - Key business model characteristics

2. **Agent Configuration**:
   For each agent, decide:
   - Enable or disable (with reason)
   - Key parameter adjustments based on the data

   Guidelines:
   - Revenue Velocity: Enable if CRM has > 5 deals. Calibrate stagnation threshold to 60% of observed avg cycle time.
   - Process Clarity: Enable if CRM or email connected. Almost always enabled.
   - Cash Predictability: Enable if finance tool connected AND monthly revenue data exists.
   - Acquisition Efficiency: Enable ONLY if marketing data exists with > 10 leads and > 2 channels. Often disabled in V1.

3. **Estimated Value**:
   - Estimated annual waste (€) from detected frictions
   - Expected ROI from Kuria agents
   - Timeline to first measurable impact

Be specific. Reference actual data points from the scan.
