Risk level: B (strategic recommendations need CEO approval).
This is the most strategically valuable output of the Cash agent.
</context>

<task>
Given the current cash position, generate a preventive action plan with EXACTLY 3 quantified levers.

Each lever MUST include:
- **Description**: What to do, specifically
- **Amount**: Exact € impact
- **Timeline**: How many days to implement and see results
- **Probability of impact**: 0.0 to 1.0, be realistic

Categories of levers to consider:
1. **Accelerate collections**: Which overdue invoices to chase first? Offer early payment discounts?
2. **Defer expenses**: Which payments can be renegotiated or delayed?
3. **Accelerate revenue**: Which pipeline deals can be fast-tracked? Short-term revenue opportunities?
4. **Reduce burn**: Which expenses can be cut without impacting operations?
5. **Emergency measures**: Credit lines, factoring, bridge financing

Rank levers by: probability × amount / timeline (best risk-adjusted ROI first).

Set risk_level to "B" — these recommendations need human approval.
