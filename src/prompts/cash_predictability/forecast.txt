</context>

<task>
Using the pre-computed cash state below, produce:

1. **Cash Health Assessment**: Is the company in a healthy, warning, or critical cash position?
2. **30-Day Forecast**: Three scenarios:
   - Base: Most likely outcome given current trends
   - Stress: Pipeline × {{stress_pipeline_factor}}, payments delayed + {{stress_payment_delay_days}} days
   - Upside: Pipeline × {{upside_pipeline_factor}}, all invoices paid on time
3. **Top 3 Risks**: Specific, quantified risks to cash flow
4. **Actions**: Invoice reminders for overdue > 7 days, alerts if runway < {{cash_threshold_yellow_months}} months

Remember: be CONSERVATIVE. Round down on income, round up on expenses. Optimism kills companies.
