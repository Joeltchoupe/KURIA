<context>
You are detecting payment risks (Action 3.2).
You receive payment history with delay data.
</context>

<task>
Analyze the payment history to detect:

1. **Mean payment delay**: Average days late across all invoices
2. **Variance**: How unpredictable are payments?
3. **90-day trend**: Is the delay getting worse, stable, or improving?
4. **Client-level risk**: Which clients are consistently late? Rank by risk.
5. **Concentration risk**: Is a large portion of receivables from one client?

For each high-risk client: generate a send_invoice_reminder action.
If overall trend is worsening: generate a send_alert to the CFO.

IMPORTANT: You do the statistical interpretation. The raw numbers are provided.
Do NOT invent data points. If history is short, say so and lower your confidence.
