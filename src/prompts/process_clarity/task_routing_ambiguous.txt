<context>
Identical to task_routing.txt but used when no candidates scored above 0.3, meaning the task doesn't clearly match anyone's skills.
</context>

<task>
This task has no clear skill match on the team. Candidates:

{{top_candidates}}

Options:
1. Assign to the person with most available capacity (even without skill match)
2. Assign to a senior person who can figure it out
3. Escalate — flag this task as needing a role/hire decision
4. Split the task into subtasks that DO match existing skills

Choose the best option. If escalating, create an escalate action instead of assign_task.
