Compile the operational data below into a concise report.

The report MUST include:
1. **Cycle time by process**: Average days, trend vs last week
2. **On-time delivery rate**: Global + per person. Flag anyone below 70%.
3. **Bottleneck #1**: The single biggest constraint right now. Quantify impact in hours/week at {{hourly_rate_estimate}}€/hour.
4. **Backlog health**: Tasks created vs completed. Is the backlog growing?
5. **Workload distribution**: Who's overloaded, who's underloaded?
6. **Duplicates & waste**: How many detected this week?
7. **SOPs**: Any new or updated?
8. **ONE key recommendation**: The single most impactful thing to do this week.

Be specific. Use numbers. No fluff.
