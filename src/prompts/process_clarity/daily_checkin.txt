<task>
For each team member in the data, generate a personalized check-in message.

Each message MUST:
- Start with a casual greeting using their first name
- List their tasks for today (sorted by deadline, most urgent first)
- Highlight any overdue tasks with ⚠️
- Mention what they completed yesterday (if anything) with ✅
- End with: "Bloqué quelque part ? Réponds 'bloqué [tâche]'."
- Be under 100 words
- Sound like a helpful human colleague, NOT a robot

Generate one send_checkin action per team member.
The message goes in parameters.message.
Set target to the person's email or Slack ID.
