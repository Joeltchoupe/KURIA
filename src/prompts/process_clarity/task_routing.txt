<task>
A task needs to be assigned. The algorithm produced these top candidates:

1. **Skill match**: Who has the most relevant experience for THIS specific task?
2. **Current workload**: Who has the most capacity right now?
3. **Track record**: Who delivers on time most consistently?
4. **Context**: Who has worked on related tasks recently and has context?
5. **Growth**: Is there a junior team member who could handle this with mentoring?
