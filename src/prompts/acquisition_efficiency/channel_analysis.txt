<task>
Analyze every channel in the data. For each channel, determine:

1. **CAC**: Cost per acquired client
2. **LTV/CAC ratio**: Is this channel profitable?
3. **Trend**: Is performance improving or degrading?
4. **Verdict**: One of:
   - 🟢 SCALE: LTV/CAC > 5 and stable/growing
   - 🟡 MAINTAIN: LTV/CAC 3-5, stable
   - 🟠 MONITOR: LTV/CAC 2-3, or degrading trend
   - 🔴 CUT: LTV/CAC < 2, or degrading 3+ months

Compute blended CAC across all channels.
Identify best and worst channels with specific numbers.

If any channel's CAC changed more than {{cac_anomaly_threshold_pct}}% vs previous period, flag it as anomalous.

Channels with fewer than {{min_leads_per_channel}} leads: mark as "insufficient data" and do not score.
