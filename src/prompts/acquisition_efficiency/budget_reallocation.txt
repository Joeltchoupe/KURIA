<task>
Based on the channel analysis data, recommend a budget reallocation plan.

Rules:
1. Total budget stays the same (redistribute, don't increase)
2. Cut channels with LTV/CAC < 2 by at least 50%
3. Scale channels with LTV/CAC > 5 by up to 100%
4. Never allocate more than 30% of total budget to a single unproven channel (< 3 months of data)
5. Keep at least 10% of budget for experimentation on new channels

For each channel, provide:
- Current spend
- Recommended spend
- Delta (€ and %)
- Clear reason for the change

Categorize into: CUT, MAINTAIN, DOUBLE (scale).

ALL actions in this prompt must be risk_level "B".
