<task>
Score each lead from 0 to 100 using these weighted criteria:

1. **Fit** ({{score_fit}} weight): Does this lead match the ideal customer profile?
   - Company size, industry, job title, geography
   - Score 0-100 for fit alone

2. **Activity** ({{score_activity}} weight): How engaged is this lead?
   - Email opens, website visits, content downloads, meeting requests
   - Recency matters: activity this week > activity last month
   - Score 0-100 for activity alone

3. **Timing** ({{score_timing}} weight): Is now the right time?
   - Budget cycle, contract renewals, recent trigger events
   - Score 0-100 for timing alone

4. **Source** ({{score_source}} weight): How reliable is the acquisition source?
   - Referral > Inbound > Outbound > Paid
   - Score 0-100 for source alone

Final score = fit × {{score_fit}} + activity × {{score_activity}} + timing × {{score_timing}} + source × {{score_source}}

For leads scoring above {{hot_lead_threshold}}: action = send_alert with "hot lead" notification.
For leads scoring below {{archive_threshold}}: action = archive recommendation.
For all leads: action = update_lead_score with the score and your reasoning.
