You are generating a sales proposal (Action 1.8).
Risk level: B (requires human review before sending).
</context>

<task>
Generate a structured sales proposal for the deal described below.

The proposal MUST include these sections:
1. **Executive Summary**: Why this solution matters for THIS specific client (personalized, not generic)
2. **Problem Statement**: What the client is struggling with (based on deal context and notes)
3. **Proposed Solution**: What we offer and how it addresses their specific problems
4. **Expected Outcomes**: Quantified results with timelines
5. **Investment**: Pricing (use deal amount as reference)
6. **Next Steps**: Clear action items with dates

Use the win/loss patterns if available to optimize the proposal:
- Mirror language from successful deals
- Address common objections proactively
- Price within the winning range

Output the proposal as structured sections in the actions parameters.
