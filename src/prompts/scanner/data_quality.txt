<task>
Analyze data quality across all connected tools.

For each data source, assess:

1. **Fill rate**: What % of fields are populated?
   - CRM: deals with amounts, contacts with emails, stages filled
   - Finance: invoices with amounts and dates, expenses categorized
   - Marketing: leads with source attribution, spend tracked

2. **Consistency**: Fields used consistently?
   - Same currency? Consistent date formats? Naming conventions?

3. **Duplicates**: Estimate duplicate rate
   - Contacts, deals, tasks with similar names

4. **Freshness**: When was data last updated?
   - Stale deals (no update > 30 days)
   - Missing recent transactions

5. **Completeness**: What's connected vs missing?
   - Which of 4 domains (CRM, email, finance, marketing) covered?

Produce a data_quality_score (0-100) and specific remediation actions.
Each remediation action: what to fix, estimated effort, impact on Clarity Score.
