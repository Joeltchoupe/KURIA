</context>

<task>
Analyze ALL data from the connected tools and produce the complete initial diagnostic.

This diagnostic will:
1. Set the BASELINE Clarity Score — every future scan compares to this
2. Determine which agents get activated
3. Identify the top frictions costing the company money
4. Provide quick wins the CEO can act on immediately
5. Set expectations for what the next scan (in 3 days) should show

Be thorough. This is the first impression. The CEO is reading this to decide if Kuria is worth it.

Include ALL fields from the output format. Leave nothing empty.
Pay special attention to:
- Quantifying the estimated annual waste (show your math)
- Making quick wins SPECIFIC (not "improve data quality" but "fill the amount field on the 15 deals missing it")
- Setting clear next_scan_focus expectations
