<task>
This is a DELTA scan — your job is to measure WHAT CHANGED in the last {{days_since_last_scan}} days.

You MUST:

1. **Compare the Clarity Score** to the previous scan ({{previous_clarity_score}}/100).
   - If improved: explain what drove the improvement. Celebrate specific wins.
   - If unchanged: flag stagnation. Recommend specific action.
   - If degraded: explain what went wrong. Create alert action.

2. **Check previous quick_wins**:
   - Were they applied? (compare current data to previous gaps)
   - If applied → mark as "applied ✅" in progression.quick_wins_applied
   - If ignored → mark in progression.quick_wins_ignored and REPEAT the recommendation

3. **Update friction status**:
   For each previous friction:
   - "resolved" if the data shows it's fixed
   - "improving" if partial progress
   - "persistent" if unchanged
   - "worsening" if it got worse
   Add any NEW frictions with status "new"

4. **Check agent recommendations**:
   - Should any agent be enabled/disabled based on new data?
   - Should any agent be recalibrated? (e.g., new tool connected → more data available)

5. **Set next_scan_focus**:
   What should we specifically look at in 3 days?
   Be precise: "Check if the 15 deals missing amounts have been filled"

Keep the report CONCISE. The CEO reads this in 2 minutes.
Focus on CHANGES, not on repeating everything from the initial scan.
