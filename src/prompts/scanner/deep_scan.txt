This is a DEEP scan — a comprehensive re-diagnostic with historical trend analysis.

You MUST produce:

1. **Full Clarity Score recalculation** with all sub-scores (as in initial scan)

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Clarity Score trajectory: plot the trend across all {{total_scans}} scans
   - Rate of improvement: points gained per scan on average
   - Projected score in 30 days at current rate
   - Areas that improved most vs least

3. **Friction Lifecycle**:
   - Which frictions from the initial scan are STILL present?
   - Which were resolved and when?
   - Any new frictions that appeared after the initial scan?
   - Cost of persistent frictions: estimated total waste since Day 0

4. **Agent Performance Review**:
   - For each active agent: is it delivering value?
   - Should any agent's configuration change significantly?
   - Should any disabled agent now be enabled (new data available)?

5. **Strategic Recommendations**:
   - What are the 3 biggest structural changes the company should make?
   - These are NOT quick wins — these are strategic moves (new tools, process redesign, team changes)
   - Each recommendation: description, estimated impact, timeline, difficulty

6. **ROI Assessment**:
   - Initial estimated annual waste vs current
   - Value captured since Day 0 (waste reduced)
   - Kuria's contribution to the improvement

This report goes to the CEO for a quarterly review.
Be thorough, data-backed, and strategic.
